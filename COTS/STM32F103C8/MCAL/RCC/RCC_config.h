 *       - RCC_HSI: High-Speed Internal Clock Source (HSI).
 *                  This option uses the internal high-speed oscillator as the system clock source.
 *                  The HSI provides a stable and accurate clock source, suitable for most applications.
 *       - RCC_HSE: High-Speed External Clock Source (HSE).
 *                  This option uses an external crystal oscillator as the system clock source.
 *                  The HSE provides a higher level of accuracy and stability compared to HSI.
 *                  It is recommended for applications requiring precise timing.
 *       - RCC_PLL: Phase-Locked Loop Clock Source (PLL).
 *                  This option uses the PLL as the system clock source, which multiplies
 *                  the frequency of an input clock source (e.g., HSI or HSE) to generate
 *                  a higher frequency output. PLL provides flexibility in tuning the clock frequency,
 *                  making it suitable for applications with specific performance requirements.
